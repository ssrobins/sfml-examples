# Let's make 16 games in C++/SFML!

This is not my code. I downloaded the code from this [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH_omFPqMO4&list=PLB_ibvUSN7mzUffhiay5g5GUHyJRO4DYr&pp=iAQB) and made some minor changes:

- Added [CMake build system](CMakeLists.txt)
- Added [Conan packages](conanfile.py) for the SFML and Box2D dependencies
- Added [GitHub Actions CI](.github/workflows/main.yml) that builds most of the games on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Made some other minor code changes

If you're the author of the original code, first of all, thank you for making this! I learned a ton and had lots of fun. If you'd prefer this not be posted here, let me know.
